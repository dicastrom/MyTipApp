## Notes

The app worked just fine....until I connected it to github. Then XCode refused to let me re-open the project, and despite the app being on the simulator and working just fine (git looked alright too) I was not able to re-open it. Tried re-opening it again and the simulator would crash seemingly randomly. Finnaly got it working after restarting an closing everything and seems to be ok.
